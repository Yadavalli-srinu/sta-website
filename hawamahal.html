                          The Hawa Mahal is a famous palace located in Jaipur, Rajasthan.<br>
                          It was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh.<br>

                          Its name means “Palace of Winds” or “Palace of Breeze.”<br>
                          The structure is made of red and pink sandstone.<br>
